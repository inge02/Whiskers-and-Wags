Whiskers & Wags
--------------------
A web application designed to provide a platform for animal lovers to access information on basic animal needs, donate to the welfare organizations, RSVP to events, and adopt available animals.

Features Client Side:
-----------------------
1) View information on basic animal needs (vaccines, deworming, etc.)
2) Donate to animal clinics
3) RSVP to events
4) Browse adoptable animals filtered by breed, age, and/or sex.
5) View images in the gallery page

Admin Side:
-----------------------
Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on events, gallery, and animal adoption pages.

Technologies Used:
-----------------------
* PHP
* CSS
* HTML
* JavaScript

Note:
----------------------
The payment page and RSVP functionality are currently dummy implementations and will be developed further in the future. The dark mode switch on the admin profile is also a placeholder.

Deployment:
----------------------
The application is currently live on Infinity Free, but the hosting is only valid for 30 days. Future plans include deploying the application on a more permanent hosting solution.

Future Development:
-----------------------
Our main focus for this project was to implement the CRUD functions to ensure that changes made on the admin side are reflected on the client side. Future development will focus on implementing real payment and RSVP functionality, as well as improving the overall user experience.
