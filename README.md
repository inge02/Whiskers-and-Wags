Whiskers & Wags
--------------------
A web application designed to provide a platform for animal lovers to access information on basic animal needs, donate to the welfare organizations, RSVP to events, and adopt available animals.

Building process 
--------------------
1) Choosing the idea – We both love animals and had adoption experiences, so creating an adoption-focused app felt personal and meaningful. 
2) Research – We looked at existing adoption websites and thought about how we could make ours unique. We also researched what kind of information and features would be most helpful for users. 
3) Wireframe and design – We each created wireframes using Miro, then compared our designs and combined the best elements into the final layout. 
4) Dividing the work – We split the pages and features between us so we could develop different parts at the same time. 
5) Coding and collaboration - We worked with GitHub, using separate branches for our work and merging them with the main project as we completed different sections. 

Features and functionality 
----------------------------
* Footer and header – The footer allows the clients to navigate to certain pages, has links to social media pages (is currently dummies, due to the business is made up) and lastly shows a GPS location link. The header navigates to every page. 
* Forgot password/Change password page – The admin need to provide a work ID and email that will be validated from the database and then allow the new password. 

Client side: 
---------------
* Home page – This page informs the clients who we are and how to contact us, where we are and subscribe to newsletters. 
* Adopt page – Shows all the available animals and allows animals to be filtered by sex, type and age. It also shows all the information on the animal that was selected. 
* Donate page – Is allows clients to make donations via normal payment, PayPal and provides a QR code for zapper and EFT details. 
* Event page – It shows all the upcoming events and allow the clients to RSVP to the event. 
* Gallery page – It shows images and when clicked on images it shows a description of it. 
* Pet care page – Has links to the basic animal care information pages. 
* Login page – Only Admins can login with their employe username and password. 

Admin side: 
-------------
* Admin side has the full functionality of CRUD. 
* Admin home page – The main dashboard where admins can navigate to other pages. 
* Edit rescues – The page allows the admin to create new adoption profiles and maintain the others. 
* Event – Allowing admins to create and manage events. 
* Gallery – This page allows the admin to add new images and manage the old ones. 
* Settings - Where admins could log out and change password credentials if needed.


Please note: 
The donate page payments and the event page’s RSVP are still dummy implementation and is planned for future development. 
The dark mode and profile button are just place holders and is also future implementations. 
Our focus was the CRUD functions. 

Tech Stack 
--------------
* Development Environment: Visual Studio 
* Frontend: HTML, CSS 
* Backend: JavaScript (For backend functions), PHP (For CRUD operations) 
* Version Control & Collaboration: GitHub (Branches, Merging, Conflict Resolution) 

Challenges and learning outcomes 
------------------------------------
We only had a week before we had to present our project which had made some impact when it came to features, prioritizing them and also at the same time had to work efficiently. 
We also used GitHub for the first time and learned throughout the process how to merge branches, how to handle conflict and how to work in a shared coding environment. 
I also got hands on experience with both front end and back-end development to make sure every thing worked as expected when changes was made on the admin side to display on the client side. 

Future ideas 
--------------
Look into a more permanent hosting site. 
Making the profile button where profile images can be uploaded, and the dark mode toggle be functional. 
Fully implement the payment and RSVP button so that it is not a dummy anymore.
